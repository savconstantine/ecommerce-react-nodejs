#### `webpack.development.config.js` `and webpack.production.frontend.config.js`

yarn install
```
Installs the dependencies.

#### Development

```Shell
yarn run dev

Removes a directory "dist" from a project

#### Building

```Shell

#### Linting

```Shell
yarn run lint
```

Code linting is a type of static analysis that is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesnâ€™t adhere to certain style guidelines.


```Shell
yarn run lint:server
```
